# Pleased to meet "ME"

Sooooo...

I have been wanting to do something like this for a while now, but as I am nearing the end of my undergraduate studies I am just starting to really have more time outside of my studies `(if you dig what I am saying?)` to focus more on my freelance work.

If you are interested, keep an eye out for some of the upcoming stuff I plan to periodically spam this site with.

For now, *Au revoir*
