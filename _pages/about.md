I am a senior at San Jose State University graduating in the Spring of 2020 with a Bachelor of Science in Business Analytics. I have experience in Python, SQL, R, Javascript and Salesforce. I am interested in exploratory analysis, machine learning and data visualization, and aspire to become a data science professional.
