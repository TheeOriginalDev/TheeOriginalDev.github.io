My name is Devon Jones (*obviously*), but you may call me Dev for short. I am a senior at San Jose State University and will be graduating in Spring of 2020 with a Bachelor of Science in Business Analytics.

I have experience in Python, SQL, R, Javascript and Salesforce and anticipate on leveraging multiple of these skills in my career as I journey to become a data scientist. I am interested in exploratory analysis, machine learning, data visualization, natural language processing, neural networks and deep learning.

There are more topics that I am interested in and I plan to make some updates to this page in the future. However, I plan to use this website to primarily highlight the projects and freelance work I do involving some of the topics I mentioned previously as well as others.

If you took the time to read this, `THANK YOU!` (*I am virtually applauding you*) Keep your eyes on the lookout for some updates and that "new-new"!

If you didn't ... we all know why.
